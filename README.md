# 👋 Hey there, I’m Gavin (@gav-vdm)  

## 🚀 About Me  
- 🎮 Interested in **Game Development** (Unity, C#, design patterns in games). I’m not actively developing right now, but it’s a field I’d like to pursue after school.  
- 🌱 Currently learning **Unity** and improving my general coding skills.  
- 🏠 Running a **homelab** with **Proxmox, Docker, and Linux** where I experiment with virtualization, networking, and self-hosted services.  
- 🌐 Doing some **basic web development** — currently working on my personal website.  
- 🔌 Looking into getting started with **Arduino & ESP32 boards** to explore electronics and IoT projects.

## ⚡ Fun Facts  
- I love breaking things in my homelab… and then fixing them (best way to learn 😅).  
- I’m curious about how different areas of tech connect — from servers to small IoT boards.  
- Tinkering with tech is my way of relaxing, even when it’s just testing small setups.
